## How to Run Tests

There are some lint tests in place to ensure each topic is formatted in the way we expect. Travis
CI will run the tests automatically. If you want to run the tests yourself locally, you will need
Ruby, Bundler, and ImageMagick installed.

You can run the tests using:

```bash
./script/cibuild
```
